					<h3>Introduction to the Covid-19</h3>
					<p class="mt-4">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally, resulting in the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Muscle pain, sputum production and sore throat are less common. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure. As of 20 March 2020, the rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases is 4.1%; however, it ranges from 0.2% to 15% depending on age and other health problems.</p>

					<p class="mt-4">Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining distance from others (social distancing), and keeping hands away from the face. The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not the general public. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.</p>
          <p class="mt-4">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Evidence of local transmission of the disease has been found in many countries across all six WHO regions.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3">Signs and Symptoms</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">Although those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic, many develop flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat may be seen. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are seen in a minority of cases, and some of the initial cases in China presented with only cardiac symptoms, like chest tightness and palpitations. In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3"><br/>Incubation Period</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">As is common with infections, there is a delay from when a person is infected with the virus to when they develop symptoms, known as the incubation period. The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to fourteen days.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Causes</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">The disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously referred to as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It is primarily spread between people via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. The virus can remain viable for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. SARS-CoV-2 can last up to three days, or in aerosols for three hours. The virus has also been found in faeces, but as of March 2020 it is unknown whether transmission through faeces is possible, and the risk is expected to be low.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-xl-8 about-right border-bottom">
					<p class="mb-3"><br/>The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme ACE2, which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein, called "spike", to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell. The density of ACE2 in each tissue correlates with the severity of the disease in that tissue and some have suggested that decreasing ACE2 activity might be protective, though another view is that increasing ACE2 using Angiotensin II receptor blocker medications could be protective and that these hypotheses need to be tested. As the alveolar disease progresses, respiratory failure might develop and death may follow.</p>

					<p class="mb-3"><br/><br/>The virus is thought to be natural and have an animal origin, through spillover infection. It was first transmitted to humans in Wuhan, China, in November or December 2019, and the primary source of infection became human-to-human transmission by early January 2020. The earliest known infection occurred on 17 November 2019. As of 14 March 2020, 67,790 cases and 3,075 deaths due to the virus have been reported in Hubei province; a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4.54%.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Diagnosis</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease. The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). The test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods. Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value. Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-xl-8 about-right border-bottom">
					<p class="mb-3">Diagnostic guidelines released by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based upon clinical features and epidemiological risk. These involved identifying people who had at least two of the following symptoms in addition to a history of travel to Wuhan or contact with other infected people: fever, imaging features of pneumonia, normal or reduced white blood cell count, or reduced lymphocyte count. A study published by a team at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan on 26 February 2020 showed that a chest CT scan for COVID-19 has greater sensitivity (98%) than the polymerase chain reaction (71%). False negative results may occur due to PCR kit failure, or due to either issues with the sample or issues performing the test. False positive results are likely to be rare.</p>

					<p class="mb-3"><br/>One study in China found that CT scans showed ground-glass opacities in 56%, but 18% had no radiological findings. Bilateral and peripheral ground glass opacities are the most typical CT findings, though they are non-specific. Consolidation, linear opacities and reverse halo sign are other radiological findings. Initially, the lesions are confined to one lung, but as the disease progresses, indications manifest in both lungs in 88% of so-called "late patients" in the study group (the subset for whom time between onset of symptoms and chest CT was 6–12 days). Ground glass opacities are also a common feature in children's disease.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-3"><br/>Prevention</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">Because a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is not expected to become available until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of managing the COVID-19 pandemic is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve through various measures seeking to reduce the rate of new infections. Slowing the infection rate helps decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of current cases, and provides more time for a vaccine and treatment to be developed.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="col-xl-8 about-right border-bottom">
					<p class="mb-3">Preventive measures are similar to those published for other coronaviruses: stay home, avoid travel and public activities, wash hands with soap and warm water often and for at least 20 seconds, practice good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. The CDC recommends covering up the mouth and nose with a tissue during any cough or sneeze and coughing or sneezing into the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available. They also recommend proper hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and canceling mass gatherings. Social distancing also includes that people stay 6 feet apart.</p>

					<p class="mb-3">According to the WHO, the use of masks is only recommended if a person is coughing or sneezing or when one is taking care of someone with a suspected infection.</p>
					<p>To prevent transmission of the virus, the CDC recommends that infected individuals stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items. CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water. It further recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. Spitting in public places also should be avoided.</p>

Research into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials. Although new medications may take until 2021 to develop, several of the medications are already in advanced testing.</p>

					<h3 class="mb-3">Prognosis</h3>
					<p class="mb-3">The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical disease may take three to six weeks to recover.</p>
          <p>Children of all ages are susceptible to the disease, but are likely to have milder symptoms and a much lower chance of severe disease than adults. Pregnant women are at particular risk for severe infection.</p>

					<p class="mb-3">In some patients COVID-19 may affect the lungs causing pneumonia. In those most severely affected, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver. Liver injury as shown by blood markers of liver damage is frequently seen in severe cases.</p>
          <p>Many of those who die of COVID-19 have preexisting conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.</p>

					<p class="mb-3">The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that, out of over 2000 deaths from the disease in the country, 99.8% had at least one preexisting condition with the average patient having 2.7. According to the same report, the median time between onset of symptoms and death was eight days with a difference of one day between patients who had been treated in an ICU compared to those who were not</p>
          <p>In a study of early cases, the median time from exhibiting initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days. In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% while women had a death rate of 1.7%.</p>

          <p>Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of a region may also affect mortality. Estimates of the mortality from the condition vary because of those regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.

It is unclear if these cases are the result of reinfection, relapse, or testing error.</p>
          <p>Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease. The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop of 20% to 30% in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.</p>

          <p>An observational study of nine people found no vertical transmission from mother to the newborn. Also, a descriptive study in Wuhan found no evidence of viral transmission through vaginal sex (from female to partner), but authors note that transmission during sex might occur through other routes.</p>

World Health Organization chief said "co" stands for "corona", "vi" for "virus" and "d" for "disease", while "19" was for the year, as the outbreak was first identified on 31 December 2019. Tedros said the name had been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (i.e. China), animal species, or group of people.</p>
