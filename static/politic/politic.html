					<p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem">When COVID-19 hit this winter, the NML began accepting tests from labs across the country—which comes with a built-in lag time, as samples need to be sent by mail or courier. “In Ontario, confirmation of positives by NML was dropped a few weeks ago,” said Krista Urchenko, a medical laboratory technologist in Ontario.</p><p>Read more <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/13/canada-shows-how-easy-virus-testing-can-be/" style="color:inherit;text-decoration: underline dotted #999">here</a></p>

But an early draft was leaked to the press while the cabinet was still discussing it, and many people scrambled to leave the “red zone,” either by train or car, before the government officially announced the decree.</p>

The Tokyo stock market fell 9.6 percent in the week.

The Pyongyang office of the World Health Organization said they received no report of an infection.</p><p style="margin-bottom:0.5rem">But it is unlikely that North Korea is free of COVID-19. North Korea’s rudimentary public health system simply lacks the ability to contain a major outbreak. It may reflect North Korea’s inability to test for the disease rather than the true absence of it. Testing for the virus requires specific primers and relatively sophisticated labs—both of which North Korea likely lacks.</p><p>Read more <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/22/covid19-pyongyang-wuhan-virus-china-kim-does-north-korea-have-the-coronavirus/" style="color:inherit;text-decoration: underline dotted #999">here</a></p>

The news set into motion a considerable public outcry targeting popular Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and pried open the wounds of a long history of racist treatment toward those of Chinese heritage.
